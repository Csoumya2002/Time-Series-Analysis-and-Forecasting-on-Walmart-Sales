# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-on-Walmart-Sales
The purpose of the project is to use Time Series Analysis and Forecasting models to predict the sales of Walmart store 01. The dataset is a csv file obtained from kaggle.com. I am able to build a model with model accuracy 96.78%. 
Any way suggested to increase the accuracy of the model will be greatly appreciated!
